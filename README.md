# 🌱 FarmVerse – Web-based Sustainable Farming Game

FarmVerse is an **educational and simulation web game** that blends **farming gameplay** with **real NASA datasets**. Players build and manage their digital farms, but every decision—watering, fertilizing, harvesting, or managing livestock—is informed by real-world satellite data.

The project was created for the **NASA Space Apps Challenge** under the challenge theme: **NASA Farm Navigators**.

## ✨ 4. Solution Overview

In **FarmVerse**, the player builds and manages a digital farm. Every decision—watering, fertilizing, harvesting, or managing livestock—is informed by NASA datasets.

* **Crop Management:** Choose crops, rotate them, and track their growth.
* **Irrigation Decisions:** Powered by **NASA’s SMAP** (Soil Moisture Active Passive) data, the game shows when and where water is most needed.
* **Crop Health Monitoring:** With **Landsat vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI)**, players detect nutrient deficiencies or early disease stress.
* **Climate Scenarios:** **GPM rainfall data** simulates drought or flood years.
* **Livestock Management:** Balance resources between crops and animals while minimizing emissions and maximizing yield.

👉 Every action is tied to real-world science, making **learning fun and interactive**.

## 🎮 5. Gameplay Mechanics

**Step 1 – Build the Farm:** Choose layout, crops, and livestock.
**Step 2 – Make Decisions:** Fertilize, irrigate, harvest, rotate crops. Use the **NASA Data Hub** to guide choices.
**Step 3 – Simulation:** Engine runs models based on datasets (yield, crop health, efficiency).
**Step 4 – Feedback & Rewards:** See results (higher yields, water saved, emissions reduced). Earn rewards for **sustainable, data-driven decisions**.

## 🛰️ 7. NASA Datasets Used

* **SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive):** Soil water content – irrigation efficiency.
* **Landsat (NDVI, EVI indices):** Crop health – disease and nutrient deficiency alerts.
* **GPM (Global Precipitation Measurement):** Rainfall – forecasting drought/flood scenarios.
* **ECOSTRESS:** Heat stress – monitoring plant stress in high temperatures.
* **MODIS Vegetation Products:** Growth trends – seasonal crop performance.
* **GRACE:** Groundwater estimates – long-term water resource planning.

## 🎓 9. Educational Value

Players learn:

* How soil moisture, rainfall, and temperature data directly affect agriculture.
* Why precision agriculture improves efficiency and reduces waste.
* How smallholder vs industrial farming needs different data resolutions.
* The importance of **sustainability, conservation, and resilience** in food systems.

🌍 FarmVerse also supports:

* **SDG 2: Zero Hunger**
* **SDG 13: Climate Action**

## 🌍 11. Impact & Future Plans

### **Impact**

* Engages students with real-world science through gamification.
* Empowers farmers to see how NASA datasets support precision agriculture.
* Encourages sustainable decision-making for food security & climate resilience.

### **Future Plans**

* Expand dataset integration (e.g., TRMM rainfall history, AIRS temperature data).
* Add **multiplayer cooperative farming** for collaborative decision-making.
* Partner with **schools & agricultural training centers** as a teaching tool.
* Release **mobile and AR versions** for wider accessibility.
